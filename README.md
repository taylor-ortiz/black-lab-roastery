# black-lab-roastery

Cindy has an up and coming start up selling coffee called Black Lab Roasteries. Cindy owns a roastery for the coffee beans she buys from all over the world and has also just hired a packaging company. Now, she needs to keep track of the distributors and the performance of her beans. She hires a Salesforce Developer (you) to build an app that gives her a visual representation of the following:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Current distributors</li>
  <li>Distributor location</li>
  <li>Type of coffee beans sold there</li>
  <li>Cost per package</li>
  <li>Map showing the locations of the business in Denver</li>
</ul>
