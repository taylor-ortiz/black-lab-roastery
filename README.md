# black-lab-roastery

Cindy has an up and coming start up selling coffee called Black Lab Roasteries. Cindy owns a roastery for the coffee beans she buys from all over the world and has also just hired a packaging company. Now, she needs to keep track of the distributors and the performance of her beans. She hires a Salesforce Developer (you) to build an app that gives her a visual representation of the following:
-Current distributors
-Distributor location 
-Type of coffee beans sold there
-Cost per package
-Map showing the locations of the business in Denver
